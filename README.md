## ðŸ“– General Information

This project performs a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** combined with **Explainable AI (XAI)** using SHAP-based methods.  
In addition, a **dynamic PDF report** containing all plots, graphs, and insights is automatically generated at runtime.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

- Understand the relationship between demographic factors and academic performance.
- Perform meaningful visualizations to detect trends and correlations.
- Explain model decisions and feature impacts using XAI (SHAP values).
- Generate a well-structured, ready-to-share PDF report automatically.

## ðŸ”¥ Project Pipeline

1. **Data Loading and Preview**
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
   - Check for missing values
   - Correct data types
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Categorical feature analysis (Countplots)
   - Numerical feature analysis (Distribution plots)
   - Correlation matrix heatmap
4. **Explainable AI (XAI) Analysis**
   - Train a basic ML model (e.g., DecisionTreeRegressor)
   - Use **SHAP** (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for:
     - Feature importance
     - Per-instance prediction explanation
5. **Automated PDF Report Generation**
   - All charts and analysis compiled into a professional PDF.
   - Report filename is dynamically generated based on date and time.

## ðŸ“ˆ Conclusions

- Completion of test preparation courses positively correlates with better exam performance.
- Gender and parental education show patterns affecting student scores.
- SHAP-based Explainable AI reveals that:
  - Test preparation and parental education level are the most influential features in predicting performance.
- Automated reporting enables quick and standardized report creation for stakeholders.
